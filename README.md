I'm Sai Sreedhar Reddy üëã
A results-driven Data Scientist with 8 years of professional experience, including 5 years of hands-on expertise in AI/ML, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Document Intelligence. My background also includes 3 years in construction design, giving me a unique perspective on cross-functional and client-facing environments.

I specialize in designing, developing, and deploying end-to-end machine learning solutions aligned with business goals in regulated domains such as healthcare, finance, and the service sector.

üöÄ What I Do
AI/ML & NLP: Expertise in document-level data extraction and retrieval systems.

Information Extraction: Developed and deployed pipelines from diverse document types (PDFs, forms, contracts) using OCR, NLP, and rule-based systems.

Scalable Solutions: Built modular retrieval systems using LangChain, FAISS, and HuggingFace embeddings for real-time document search and semantic querying.

System Architecture: Proficient in technical design documentation, system architecture planning, and contributing to codebase with best practices.

Data Integrity: Developed automated data validation and anomaly detection rules to ensure compliance with internal and external standards.

RAG Architectures: Skilled in deploying Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance document processing workflows.

AI & EDA: Used Ollama and Mistral for advanced exploratory data analysis (EDA) and uncovering complex data insights.

Collaboration: Led cross-functional efforts with engineering, IT, and data governance teams.
